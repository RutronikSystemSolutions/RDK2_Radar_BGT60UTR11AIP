/**
 * @brief Perform range FFT on the samples contained inside the frame buffer
 *
 * @param [in] frame	Contains the samples (between 0 and 4096) measured by the radar.
 * 						Size of this buffer should be: antenna_count * num_chirps_per_frame * num_samples_per_chirp
 * 						The samples are interleaved
 * 						frame[0] -> antenna 0 sample 0
 * 						frame[1] -> antenna 1 sample 0
 *
 * @param [inout] range	Contains the result of the range FFT computation
 * 						Size of this buffer is antenna_count * num_chirps_per_frame * (num_samples_per_chirp / 2)
 * 						range[0] -> antenna 0, chirp 0, range index 0
 * 						range[1] -> antenna 0, chirp 0, range index 1
 *						range[num_samples_per_chirp / 2] -> antenna 0, chirp 1, range index 0
 *
 * @param [in] adc_samples	Buffer used to unpack the samples contained in frame into time buffer used to compute real FFT
 *
 * @param [in] mean_removal	If true, mean will be subtracted from the time buffer
 *
 * @param [in] win		Window to be applied on time buffer before computing FFT
 *
 * @param [in] antenna_count	Number of antennas
 *
 * @param [in] num_samples_per_chirp	Number of ADC samples per chirp
 *
 * @param [in] num_chirps_per_frame		Number of chirps per frame
 *
 * @retval 0 	Success
 * @retval != 0	Error occurred
